README for ML Phenology Analysis


Overview

This repository contains a series of R scripts designed for analyzing phenology 
data using machine learning techniques. The code facilitates data acquisition, 
model building, statistical analysis, and visualization of results related to 
plant phenology in South Africa.

File that can be found:

ML Phenology - Build_model_v2.R
description: This script is focused on building machine learning models to analyze phenological data. It uses a combonation of R and python. It will save the model and the optimal results.


ML Phenology - Get iNat records from GBIF_v2.R
description: This script retrieves research-grade plant records from iNaturalist via GBIF from the occurrence.txt and multimedia.txt files.

ML phenology - Run_ML_function_v2.R
description: This script loads necessary libraries and prepares the environment for running the machine learning model. It will run through a large directory of images and create an output file for the results.


ML phenology - Plots v2.R & ML phenology - Plots.R
description: These scripts contain functions for generating various plots related to phenological data.



ML phenology - Testing the two-step method.R

description: This script tests a two-step methodology in the analysis of phenological data.

ML Phenology - Additional stat functions.R
description: This script contains custom optional statistical functions to assist in the analysis, such as calculating circular means and standard devation.
